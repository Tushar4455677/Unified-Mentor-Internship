## 🚀 How to Run the Project (Step-by-Step)

### Option A — VS Code + Live Server (Recommended)
1) **Install VS Code**
   - Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/

2) **Install Live Server Extension**
   - Open VS Code → **Extensions** (`Ctrl + Shift + X`)
   - Search **“Live Server”** (by Ritwick Dey) → **Install**
   - (If needed) Reload VS Code

3) **Get the Source Code**
   - **Git (recommended):**
     ```bash
     git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
     ```
   - **OR** click **Code → Download ZIP**, then **Extract** the ZIP

4) **Open the Project Folder in VS Code**
   - VS Code → **File → Open Folder…**
   - Select your portfolio project folder (the one containing `index.html`)

5) **Run with Live Server**
   - Open `index.html` in VS Code
   - Right-click → **Open with Live Server**
   - Your browser will open automatically (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500`)

---

### Option B — Without VS Code (Quick Preview)
1) Locate `index.html` in the project folder  
2) Double-click to open in your default browser  
> Note: Some JS/CSS features that rely on a local server may not work with direct file opening.

### Option C — Simple Local Server (Alternative)
- **Python 3 (cross-platform):**
  ```bash
  # run this inside the project folder
  python -m http.server 8080
